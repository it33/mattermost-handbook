## Accrualify Vendor Portal Guide

As of December 1, 2020, the Finance team has implemented a new Procure-to-Pay automation software called Accrualify for the Procurement and Accounts Payable function. As a vendor, you will receive an invitation to the vendor portal so that you can do the following:

 1. Provide company information
 2. Set up your bank account for faster payments
 3. Upload invoices
 4. Provide monthly accruals

### How to set up your account
After your contract has been signed and completed by Mattermost, you will receive a welcome email from Accrualify to set up your account on the vendor portal. The email will include a button to “Set up your account”.
